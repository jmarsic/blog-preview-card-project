## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- This is my first time using local fonts :crossed_fingers:

First we need to add `@font-face` rules to load web font:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  src: url(./assets/fonts/static/Figtree-SemiBold.ttf);
}
```

After defining within CSS we use them:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Figtree", cursive;
}
```
